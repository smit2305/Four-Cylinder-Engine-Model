   Four cyllinder engine(Straight-four engine)

> Descriptipn:-  
    A straight-four engine (also called an 
 inline-four) is a four-cylinder piston 
 engine where cylinders are arranged in a 
 line along a common crankshaft.
    A four-stroke (also four-cycle) engine
 is an internal combustion (IC) engine in
 which the piston completes four separate
 strokes while turning the crankshaft. A
 stroke refers to the full travel of the
 piston along the cylinder, in either
 direction. The four separate strokes are
 termed: (1)Intake
         (2)Compression
         (3)Combustion
         (4)Exhaust
    These four strokes can also be referred
 to as "suck, squeeze, bang, blow" respectively,
 which can be easier to remember.   


> Usage:-
  - in production cars
  - in racing cars
  - in motorcycles etc...

   
> Advantages:-
    The four-cylinder, inline four is small and 
 compact, meaning it easily fits in nearly any 
 engine bay. It's also lightweight, and with only
 one exhaust manifold, weight is further reduced.
 With only one cylinder head, there are fewer
 moving parts than engines with multiple cylinder
 banks.


> Disadvantages:-
  - This type of arrangements has cooling issues.
  - This type of arrangement needs a large nose
 due to longer engine and this could cause issue
 in bumper to bumper traffic.
  - This type of arrangements have high center
 of gravity as compared to layout.


> What is a big advantage of a four-cylinder engine?
     The benefits of a 4-cylinder engine include: 4-cylinder
 engines tend to be fuel-efficient and are a great buy if you
 are looking for a small and reliable car. 4-cylinder engines
 have less of an impact on your carbon footprint than a
 6-cylinder engine.
 

> Why is 4 cylinder better?
     Four cylinder engines are typically inline engines (the
 4 cylinders are in a straight line as opposed to a V shape
 like most 6 cylinder engines), making them smaller and lighter
 weight. This gives them greater fuel economy, but less power,
 making them ideal for smaller vehicles
 
 
 > Who made the first 4 cylinder car?
   Karl Benz
     1885/1886 Karl Benz designed and built his own four-stroke
 engine that was used in his automobile, which was developed in
 1885, patented in 1886, and became the first automobile in 
 series production.
