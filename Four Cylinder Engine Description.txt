   Four cyllinder engine(Straight-four engine)

> Descriptipn:-  
    A straight-four engine (also called an 
 inline-four) is a four-cylinder piston 
 engine where cylinders are arranged in a 
 line along a common crankshaft.
    A four-stroke (also four-cycle) engine
 is an internal combustion (IC) engine in
 which the piston completes four separate
 strokes while turning the crankshaft. A
 stroke refers to the full travel of the
 piston along the cylinder, in either
 direction. The four separate strokes are
 termed: (1)Intake
         (2)Compression
         (3)Combustion
         (4)Exhaust
    These four strokes can also be referred
 to as "suck, squeeze, bang, blow" respectively,
 which can be easier to remember.   


> Usage:-
  - in production cars
  - in racing cars
  - in motorcycles etc...

   
> Advantages:-
    The four-cylinder, inline four is small and 
 compact, meaning it easily fits in nearly any 
 engine bay. It's also lightweight, and with only
 one exhaust manifold, weight is further reduced.
 With only one cylinder head, there are fewer
 moving parts than engines with multiple cylinder
 banks.


> Disadvantages:-
  - This type of arrangements has cooling issues.
  - This type of arrangement needs a large nose
 due to longer engine and this could cause issue
 in bumper to bumper traffic.
  - This type of arrangements have high center
 of gravity as compared to layout.
